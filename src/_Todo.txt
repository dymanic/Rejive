A minimalist audio player: just what I need to listen to music, and nothing more.

Objectives:

 - Portable, no instalation required
 - Smallest .exe, and fewest dependancies possible
 - Looks that don't embarrass

  - change hover behaviour to use a highlight colour instead of drawing a box
  - remove navigatable track
  - remove drag/drop/reorder in playlist
  - have a couple of fore/background colours preset
  - remove options form
  - remove scan types
  - move media playback to bass.net or some other single file decoder
  - do I **need** pictures?
  - Remove id3 tags
  - Have an 'online' toggle. When on, fetch pictures / ID tag data from online music service, cache this. Make the feature opt in
  - program a visualisation
  - do i need:
	- Random?
